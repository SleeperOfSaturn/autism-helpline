  <p>Autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder, manifests in a variety of symptoms that typically become apparent during early childhood. One of the hallmark symptoms is challenges in social interaction and communication. Children with autism may struggle with understanding social cues, maintaining eye contact, and engaging in reciprocal conversations. Additionally, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests are common indicators, such as repetitive movements (e.g., hand flapping) or fixations on specific topics or objects. Sensory sensitivities, like being overly sensitive or under-responsive to sensory stimuli such as lights, sounds, or textures, are also prevalent. The severity and combination of these symptoms can vary widely among individuals with autism, highlighting the spectrum nature of the condition. Early diagnosis and intervention play crucial roles in helping individuals with autism thrive by addressing their unique needs and strengths.</p>
